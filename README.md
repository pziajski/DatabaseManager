# Database Manager
This is a project created for a class, introduction to C# programming. The purpose of 
this project was to create a Windows Form that could add, edit, modify, and delete entries found in a 
Microsoft Access file. In this project I used previously learnt concepts, fundamentals of C#, and new  concepts, using the OleDB database manager alongside SQL commands to perform all required tasks.

# Requirements
* Microsoft Access Database Engine 2016 Redistributable 32-bit version (64-bit does not seem to work)
* Microsoft Access
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 (this program was made in version 2017 and may not function properly in earlier versions)
