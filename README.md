# Database Manager
This is a project created for a class of mine that taught an introduction to C# programming. The purpose of 
this project was to write a Windows Form in C# that could add, edit, modify, and delete entries found in a 
Microsoft Access file. In this project I used previous C# concepts, a new concept called OleDB and SQL 
commands.
